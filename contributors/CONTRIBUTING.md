### Contributing to Projects

When contributing to the community project, please first discuss the change you want to make through GitHub Issues or Discussions to ensure it aligns with the project's long-term plans.

## Opening a Pull Request

We Use [GitHub Flow](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/github-flow)

Emporous follows the standard [github pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/) process.
When applicable, we encourage [draft pull requests](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/changing-the-stage-of-a-pull-request) for early feedback and better communication.

## Code Review

Each repository contains a `CODEOWNERS` file that will enable auto-assigment of PR reviewers. 
At least one reviewer from the `CODEOWNERS` file must approve to merge a pull request.

## Best practices

- Write clear and meaningful git commit messages.
- Follow the conventional commit [specification](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/).
- When applicable, breaking units of works into separate commits or pull requests.
- Each pull request should be tied to a GitHub issue and specified in the pull request description.
- If a change is small, please squash commits for a cleaner history.

> Keep in mind, each individual project may have its own additional contributing guides. If any guidelines conflict with this document, please open a GitHub issue on the project repository.

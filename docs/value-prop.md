# What is Emporous?

Emporous is a smart proxy for container registries that enables organizations to easily store, manage, and search software artifact metadata alongside the artifacts themselves. Emporous allows organizations to store critical information, such as trust, compliance, and runtime instructions as metadata and to use this metadata to implement policies and procedures. With Emporous, organizations can easily discover software artifacts by searching for attributes within the metadata, making it easier for them to ensure their software is secure and compliant, without having to manually check each artifact.

## Benefits:

- Allows organizations to easily discover software artifacts by searching for attributes within the metadata
- Gives organizations confidence that their software is secure and compliant

# High Level Project Goals

1. Create a smart proxy system for container registries that allows metadata to be stored alongside software artifacts.
2. Allow for a variety of metadata types to be stored, including but not limited to provenance, SBOM, and runtime instruction metadata.
3. Implement the ability for the software artifact to self-describe using the stored metadata.
4. Test and evaluate the system to ensure that metadata is discoverable and verifiable.
5. Integrate the system into existing container registry infrastructure and standards.

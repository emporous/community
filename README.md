## Summary

The UOR-Framework can be broken down into three major sections:

### Universal Object Reference Model  
UORM is an attribute-based addressing system. Objects within UOR are referenced by a subset of their attributes and UORM defines how those references are made. UORM has been referred to as defining the neurons of the UOR-Framework.

### Universal Runtime
If UORM defines the neurons, then UR defines the synapses of the UOR-Framework. UR has two parts:
1. A UR Client capable of interacting with UOR Artifacts.
2. A runtime instruction that is embedded within UOR Artifacts that is executed by the UR Client. 

### Provider Integrations
Provider integrations are referenced by the UR Client when interacting with object stores. Some examples of object storage providers are [OCI](https://github.com/opencontainers/distribution-spec) and [IPFS](https://ipfs.io/)

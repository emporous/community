# About Us

## What is Emporous?

Emporous is a smart proxy for container registries that enables organizations to easily store, manage, and search software artifact metadata alongside the artifacts themselves. Emporous allows organizations to store critical information, such as trust, compliance, and runtime instructions as metadata and to use this metadata to implement policies and procedures. With Emporous, organizations can easily discover software artifacts by searching for attributes within the metadata, making it easier for them to ensure their software is secure and compliant, without having to manually check each artifact.

### Benefits:

- Securely stores, manages and search software artifact metadata
- Enables organizations to implement trust, compliance and runtime policies
- Provides a unified place to store and manage metadata
- Allows organizations to easily discover software artifacts by searching for attributes within the metadata
- Gives organizations confidence that their software is secure and compliant
- Reduces manual checks on artifacts.

## High Level Project Goals

1. Create a smart proxy system for container registries that allows metadata to be stored alongside software artifacts.
2. Allow for a variety of metadata types to be stored, including but not limited to provenance, SBOM, and runtime instruction metadata.
3. Implement the ability for the software artifact to self-describe using the stored metadata.
4. Test and evaluate the system to ensure that metadata is discoverable and verifiable.
5. Integrate the system into existing container registry infrastructure and standards.
